    <h1>Visual Studio</h1>
    This extension is a collection of functions that makes your presentation more streamlined and easier to watch.
    <h2>Snippets</h2>
    This extension makes it possible to type out a snippet, character by character, by pressing any button. <br />
    This is the perfect extension for people showing code on stage, in a classroom, or a workshop.<br />
    <br /><br />

    <br /><br />
    Steps:<br />
    1. Select some code<br />
    2. Right-click and select <strong>Create snippet</strong><br />
    3. Name the snippet<br />
    4. Now type the name of the snippet in a comment in the code //Snippetname (most comment types work)<br />
    5. Make sure the cursor is on the same line as the comment
    Press CTRL + TAB + TAB<br />
    The Extension now takes over, and you can press any button (except TAB) to type one character at a time.<br />
    6. To exit the extension, press TAB.<br /><br />

    The snippets are saved in a " Snippets" folder in the solution folder.<br />

    <h3>Commands</h3>
    CTRL + TAB + TAB is the default key combination. However, you can remap it in Tools | Options | Keyboard.<br />
    In some cases, you need to remap it to make it work.
    <br /><br />
    There are three commands:<br />
    <b>StageCoder.Reloadsnippets</b><br />
    If you copy snippets or manipulate them outside the extension, this will reload the snippets.<br /><br />
    <b>StageCoder.Replacecode</b><br />
    It will replace the comment with the snippet without typing each character.<br /><br />
    <b>StageCoder.Typecode</b><br />
    It will enable you to press any button (except TAB) to type one character at a time taken from the snippet.
    <br />
    <b>StageCoder.ToggleCodeHighlight</b><br />
    It will toggle the code highlight <br /><br />
    <h3>Stream Deck</h3>
    While presenting, we can also use a Stream Deck by using the "Visual Studio"-plugin by Nicollas R.<br />
    Adding the commands above can trigger the different commands by pressing the Stream Deck button.<br /><br />
    To configure the type command, do the following:<br />
    1. Install the Visual Studio plugin from the plugin store.<br />
    2. Drag <strong>Execute Command</strong> to a button.<br />
    3. Add a Title (This can be anything)<br />
    4. Add a Command(Name) in this case <strong>StageCoder.Typecode</strong><br />
    5. Command args can be used in three ways.<br />
    <strong>Empty</strong> - Will use the current line in Visual Studio to figure out the snippet name.<br />
    <strong>SnippetName</strong> - By supplying it with a snippet name, you can trigger that particular snippet.<br />
    <strong>[clipboard]</strong> - Will take the current text on the clipboard and use that as a snippet.


    <br /><br /><br />
    <h2>Highlighting code</h2>
    The second function makes it possible to highlight code by blurring the rest of the code.
    This is perfect for focusing on a specific part of the code while presenting.<br /><br />
    <img class="demo" src="Highlight.gif" /><br /><br />
    Almost everytime I use this function, someone comes up to me and asks what I am using. 
    When toggling the highlighting it will close the currently open file and reopen it.<br />
    This does take a couple of seconds to do, but it is worth it.<br />
    So my recommendation is to have it running through your whole presentation.<br />
    I rarely turn it off, because it helps me to focus as well.
